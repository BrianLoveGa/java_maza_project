Making a java program to run a java maze


From edx course DEV276x: Learn to Program in Java!


For your final project you will be writing the code for "MazeRunner", 
a program that lets a user navigate through a given maze. 


The code for the Maze is already written, and provided in "Maze.java". 


You just need to write the code that uses Maze and decides how to move through it.
